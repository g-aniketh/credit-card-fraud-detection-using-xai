# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Ensemble Learning and XAI

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline to detect credit card fraud using several ensemble classifiers combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. Designed to handle the rare-event nature of fraudulent transactions, the system applies SMOTE to balance the dataset and trains multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.

To meet the critical need for transparency in financial applications, model interpretability is provided through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations). The approach ensures high predictive accuracy while offering both global and local explanations for model decisions.
